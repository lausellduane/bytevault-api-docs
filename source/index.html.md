# Introduction

Welcome to the ByteVault API! You can use our API to access ByteVault API endpoints, which can get information on code snippets in our database.

This documentation describes how to use the API to get, create, edit and delete data within ByteVault. Do not hesitate to contact us should you require additional information or technical support.

The API is always under development. Changes to the data model and to functions often occur, but we do our best to minimize the impact of such modifications.

# Authentication

Currently ByteVault doesn't support authentication. Adding authentication flow is in the roadmap.
